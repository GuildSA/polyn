      <p>Welcome to the beta release of VinylRecords.io. The purpose of this little web app is quite simple. We want to help record stores that can’t afford to waste money of online ads get found, and we want to help the collectors of vinyl records find what they’re looking for without having to call or email every shop in town.</p>
      <p>Sounds great, right? But how does it work? Well, the app maintains a list of all record stores that we know of. You can use this list to find out more about the stores near you. You can even alter the search to see record stores in other locations if you wish, but the real power of the app is the ability to send a Vinyl Request to all the stores simultaneously.</p>
      <p>That’s right, instead of having to call or email each store individually about that awesome first pressing you’ve been searching for your whole life – you can simply send a Vinyl Request to all the stores at once! Each store will receive a notification describing what you’re looking for and if they have it, they can contact you back via a private chat within the app. It’s so simple even your grandmother can use it to find that Elvis Christmas album she keeps going on and on about.</p>
      <p>Of course, for this magic to work we need record store owners to sign up, so if you’re collector and you notice that your favorite record store is un-claimed on the app, please tell them about us and convince them to sign up.</p>

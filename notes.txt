I did the step below in Firebase for Goodz! so I could run the app using 
"polymer serve --open"

Error: This domain (127.0.0.1) is not authorized to run this operation. 
Add it to the OAuth redirect domains list in the 
Firebase console -> Auth section -> Sign in method tab.

 -- Misc. --

polymer serve --open

polymer build
polymer serve build/default/ --open
firebase deploy


bower install --save PolymerElements/iron-image#2.0-preview
bower install --save polymerfire#2.0-preview

You're about to initialize a Firebase project in this directory:

  /Users/kharris/Desktop/temp/temp

? What Firebase CLI features do you want to setup for this directory? Database: Deploy Firebase Realtime Database
 Rules, Functions: Configure and deploy Cloud Functions, Hosting: Configure and deploy Firebase Hosting sites

=== Project Setup

First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add, 
but for now we'll just set up a default project.

? Select a default Firebase project for this directory: goodz (goodz-7e036)

=== Database Setup

Firebase Realtime Database Rules allow you to define how your data should be
structured and when your data can be read from and written to.

? What file should be used for Database Rules? database.rules.json
✔  Database Rules for goodz-7e036 have been downloaded to database.rules.json.
Future modifications to database.rules.json will update Database Rules when you run
firebase deploy.

=== Functions Setup

A functions directory will be created in your project with a Node.js
package pre-configured. Functions can be deployed with firebase deploy.

✔  Wrote functions/package.json
✔  Wrote functions/index.js
? Do you want to install dependencies with npm now? Yes

=== Hosting Setup

Your public directory is the folder (relative to your project directory) that
will contain Hosting assets to be uploaded with firebase deploy. If you
have a build process for your assets, use your build's output directory.

? What do you want to use as your public directory? build/default
? Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? Yes
✔  Wrote build/default/index.html

i  Writing configuration info to firebase.json...
i  Writing project information to .firebaserc...

✔  Firebase initialization complete!
